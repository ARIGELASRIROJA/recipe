<pstyle="font-size:20px; text-align:right;" > <br>Ingredients:

- 2-3 large potatoes
- Vegetable oil for frying
- Salt, to taste
- Optional: Additional seasonings such as paprika, garlic powder, or chili powder

Instructions:

1. Select the right potatoes: Look for potatoes that are high in starch, like Russet or Idaho.

2. Wash and peel: Wash the potatoes thoroughly, then peel them using a vegetable peeler.

3. Cut: Cut the peeled potatoes into long, thin strips. You can either cut them by hand or use a French fry cutter.

4. Soak: Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch.

5. Dry: Drain the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

6. Heat oil: Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to around 350°F (175°C).

7. Double fry: Double frying is the secret to crispy French fries. Fry the potatoes in batches until they're slightly tender, around 3-4 minutes. Remove them from the oil and let them cool completely.

8. Finish frying: Increase the oil temperature to around 375°F (190°C). Fry the cooled potatoes in batches until they're golden brown and crispy, around 2-3 minutes.

9. Season: Remove the French fries from the oil and sprinkle salt and any additional seasonings you like.

10. Serve: Serve hot and enjoy!
